# PHP-IP-Location-Tool
An IP Address Location Tool I created which grabs your user's Internet provider client IP address 
(not always useful but sometimes can be interesting) and looks up its location.  

I use it on my website, www.lauriermantel.com.  I have it set up so I get an email whenever I get a view from a new IP address
(also configured with a MySQL database)
